This is a simple project with a unique feature to explain how to Clean Arquitecture works in a real project.

* `SERVER_PORT`
* `MONGO_URL`
* `EMAIL_HOST`

I use [Brevo](https://www.brevo.com) to able SMTP server and test of send email.

## Topics Covered
* Clean Architecture
* TypeScript with Node.js
* TDD
